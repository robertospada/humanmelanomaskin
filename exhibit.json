Imaging Mass Cytometry\u2122(IMC\u2122) enables the visualization and analysis of the complex spatial biology of the TME. IMC permits detailed assessment of cell phenotype and function using 40-plus markers simultaneously at subcellular resolution on a single slide without spectral overlap or autofluorescence. The ability to analyze multiple markers can facilitate accurate prediction of disease progression and clinical outcome measures from precious tissue samples and microarrays. Here, we demonstrate how our reagents and technology support these applications.\n\nHigh-plex antibody panels targeting T cells, natural killer cells, myeloid cells, immune checkpoint markers, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins were used to study the immune microenvironment in multiple cancer histologies.
